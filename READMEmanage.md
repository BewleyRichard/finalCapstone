## Description 

In this task, I created an employee management programme in JavaScript to demonstrate the use of OOP.
The script ‘manages’ different kinds of employees in a sales department. 
Each month, all the employees have an employee-specific sales target expressed as the number of successful sales. 
This script will showcase how the compensation of such employees will be managed.

## Installation 

To run a JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code, open the file in the editor, bring up the terminal,
type node followed by the name of the file (e.g., "node manage.js"), and hit enter to run the script.

## Usage 

Under the assumption of three pre-set employee types: salaried, hourly, and hybrid, 
for two instances of each employee, the following is performed:
* Monthly payout is calculated.
* The employee's name, type, and payout, along with the formula used, are displayed in the console.
* Sales targets and data can be fabricated as needed.
