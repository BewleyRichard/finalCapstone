## Description 

<p>In this task I created a Caesar cypher in JavasScipt to demonstrate the use of arrays, functions and string handling. 

A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter in a plaintext message with a letter shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

In this example we shift to the right of the alphabet by 15 letters and allow the user to enter any message through a prompt. 

## Installation 
To run a JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code, open the file in the editor, bring up the terminal, type node followed by the name of the file (e.g.node cypher.js`) and hit enter to run the script.

## Usage 
Upon being prompt enter your message and press enter. Your message will be returned encyrpted as a string of letters.
